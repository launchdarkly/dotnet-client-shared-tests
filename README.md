LaunchDarkly SDK Shared Test Code
=================================
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-shared-tests.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-shared-tests)

This project provides support code for testing LaunchDarkly .NET SDK integrations. Feature store implementations, etc., should use this code whenever possible to ensure consistent test coverage and avoid repetition.

The code is not published to NuGet, since it isn't of any use in any non-test context. Instead, it's meant to be used as a Git submodule. Add the submodule to your project like this:

    git submodule add git@github.com:launchdarkly/dotnet-client-shared-tests.git dotnet-client-shared-tests
    git submodule init

Now you can add the project `LaunchDarkly.Client.SharedTests.csproj` within the submodule to your solution, and reference its classes in your tests.

To update the copy of `dotnet-client-shared-tests` in your repository to reflect changes in this one:

    git submodule update --remote --merge

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
